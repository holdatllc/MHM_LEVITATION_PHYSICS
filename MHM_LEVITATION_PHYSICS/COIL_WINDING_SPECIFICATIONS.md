## 🔧 **STEP-BY-STEP WINDING PROCEDURE**

### **🏠 Home Version Winding (50 Turns)**

#### **Materials Needed:**
```
✅ Ferrite rod: 10cm × 2cm diameter
✅ 16 AWG copper wire: 8 meters per coil
✅ Electrical tape: For securing ends
✅ Wire strippers: For lead preparation
✅ Marker: For counting turns
✅ Drill (optional): For consistent winding
```

#### **Winding Steps:**
```
Step 1: Secure Starting End
- Strip 5cm of insulation from wire end
- Tape wire end to ferrite rod
- Leave 20cm lead for connections

Step 2: Begin Winding (CLOCKWISE)
- Wind tightly against the rod surface
- Keep turns close together but not overlapping
- Count each complete turn around the rod

Step 3: Count Carefully
- Mark every 10th turn with tape
- Turn 10: Small tape mark
- Turn 20: Small tape mark  
- Turn 30: Small tape mark
- Turn 40: Small tape mark
- Turn 50: FINAL TURN - secure with tape

Step 4: Finish Coil
- Leave 20cm lead at end
- Strip 5cm insulation from end lead
- Secure entire winding with electrical tape
- Test resistance: Should read ~0.5Ω
```

### **🏭 Full System Winding (108 Turns)**

#### **Materials Needed:**
```
✅ Ferrite rod: 25cm × 5cm diameter
✅ 14 AWG copper wire: 20 meters per coil
✅ Kapton tape: High-temperature insulation
✅ Wire strippers: Heavy duty for 14 AWG
✅ Turn counter: Mechanical or digital
✅ Winding jig: For consistent tension
```

#### **Professional Winding Steps:**
```
Step 1: Prepare Core
- Clean ferrite rod surface
- Apply thin layer of insulation tape
- Mark layer boundaries (4 layers of 27 turns each)

Step 2: Layer 1 (Turns 1-27)
- Start at one end of core
- Wind 27 turns clockwise
- Keep tight, even spacing
- Mark completion with tape

Step 3: Insulation Layer
- Apply Kapton tape over Layer 1
- Ensure complete coverage
- No gaps or overlaps

Step 4: Layer 2 (Turns 28-54)
- Wind 27 turns over insulation
- Maintain same direction (clockwise)
- Keep consistent tension

Step 5: Repeat for Layers 3 & 4
- Layer 3: Turns 55-81
- Layer 4: Turns 82-108
- Insulation between each layer

Step 6: Final Securing
- Secure final turn with high-temp tape
- Test resistance: Should read ~0.1Ω
- Test inductance: Should read ~50mH

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL WINDING WARNINGS**

### **🚨 TURN COUNT IS CRITICAL:**
```
❌ WRONG: 49 turns or 51 turns (home version)
✅ CORRECT: EXACTLY 50 turns (home version)

❌ WRONG: 107 turns or 109 turns (full system)  
✅ CORRECT: EXACTLY 108 turns (full system)

⚠️ Even 1-2 turn difference will affect:
   - Resonance frequency tuning
   - Power efficiency optimization
   - Tesla 3-6-9 harmonic alignment
   - System stability and performance
```

### **🔧 WINDING QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:**
```
✅ Tight, even winding (no loose turns)
✅ Consistent spacing between turns
✅ Proper insulation between layers (full system)
✅ Secure end connections with proper leads
✅ Clean, professional appearance
✅ Electrical testing before installation
```

### **⚡ SAFETY DURING WINDING:**
```
⚠️ Wear safety glasses (wire under tension)
⚠️ Use proper wire strippers (avoid nicks)
⚠️ Keep workspace clean and organized
⚠️ Test each coil before installation
⚠️ Label each coil clearly (Coil 1, 2, 3, etc.)
```

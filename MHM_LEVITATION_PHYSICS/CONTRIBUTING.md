## 🛠️ **Development Guidelines**

### **📝 Code Standards**

#### **Arduino/C++ Code:**
```cpp
// Use clear, descriptive variable names
float coil_current_amps = 5.0;  // Good
float c = 5.0;                  // Bad

// Include safety checks
if (current_reading > MAX_SAFE_CURRENT) {
    emergency_shutdown();
    return ERROR_OVERCURRENT;
}

// Document complex algorithms
/**
 * MHM Tesla 3-6-9 Frequency Calculation
 * Based on Miller Harmonic Method principles
 * @param base_freq: Base frequency in Hz
 * @return: Optimized frequency array
 */
```

#### **Python Code:**
```python
# Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
# Use type hints where appropriate
def calculate_hover_height(current: float, magnetic_field: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate expected hover height based on current and field strength.
    
    Args:
        current: Coil current in Amperes
        magnetic_field: Field strength in Tesla
        
    Returns:
        Expected hover height in meters
    """
    # Safety check
    if current > MAX_SAFE_CURRENT:
        raise ValueError(f"Current {current}A exceeds safe limit")
    
    return calculate_magnetic_force(current, magnetic_field) / GRAVITY
```
